# Proposals

This is a location to record all design decisions and proposals at GWG.

A _proposal_ is a request for improvement and should provide:

- Context on the current state
- Proposed changes to achieve the goals
- Detailed reasoning
- Example scenarios
- Discussions of pros, cons, hazards and alternatives
- follow the [Template](./TEMPLATE.md)

## Rules

The current process for proposals is:

- A proposal is drafted and discussed in a dedicated pull request.
- A proposal, once finalized, should not be significantly modified.
- A proposal can be superseded by another proposal.
- When a design document's decision is superseded, a reference to the new design should be added to its text.
