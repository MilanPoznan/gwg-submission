# Request For Proposals (RFP)

A request for proposal is a document that a business drafts when that business is seeking out multiple bids for one (or multiple) outsourced projects. The document should provide:

- Detailed project description, including: expected functionality, requirements, assumptions, expected user profile, dependencies and possible outline some preferences related to the solution.
- Scope of the project, to allow bidders evaluate the complexity and cost of the project.
- Rough timeline for posting the bids, making a decision and expected delivery time.
- Any possible roadblocks.
- Optionally: budget estimate (if it's known)

The goal of a RFP process is to find and select contractors capable and competitive to deliver the requested project with a professional and quality solution. The process makes the selection clearer and easier from the outset.
