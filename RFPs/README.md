# Request For Proposals (RFP)

A request for proposal is a document that a business drafts when that business is seeking out multiple bids for one (or multiple) outsourced projects. The document should provide:

- Detailed project description, including: expected functionality, requirements, assumptions, expected user profile, dependencies and possible outline some preferences related to the solution.
- Scope of the project, to allow bidders evaluate the complexity and cost of the project.
- Rough timeline for posting the bids, making a decision and expected delivery time.
- Any possible roadblocks.
- Optionally: budget estimate (if it's known)

The goal of a RFP process is to find and select contractors capable and competitive to deliver the requested project with a professional and quality solution. The process makes the selection clearer and easier from the outset.

## Drafting RFP

1. Discuss the need or the problem with the GWG community.
2. Once getting initial feedback, create an issue: this will allow to track the proposal from the draft to the finish line.
3. Evaluate how important it is. What are the consequences of not building it?
4. Draft the scope, requirements, timeline, expected functionality etc...
5. Clarify selection criteria.
6. Collect all of it in a new RFP document based on the [template](./TEMPLATE.md)
7. Submit the new RFP using GitHub Pull Request. Save it in `RFPs/rfps/<rfp-number>-title.md`.
   Make sure the `<rfp-number>` is a not used sequence number. You can use the issue number for that.
8. RFP draft may have few iterations.
9. After successful review and approval, the RFP status should be set to `approved`. At that stage, anyone can submit proposals.
10. Rejected proposals must have status set to `rejected`.
