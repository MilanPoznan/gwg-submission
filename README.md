# GWG proposals and design documents

This repository collects NDC GWG design documents and request for proposals.
Follow into related directory for details and a list of proposals.

- Request for Proposals (RFP): list of projects with a specification and request for teams to implement it.
- Improvement Proposals (IP): list of proposals to improve processes and overall NDC organization. IP can turn out into RFP.

Both directories are inspired by [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) and [NEAR Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/near/NEPs/).
