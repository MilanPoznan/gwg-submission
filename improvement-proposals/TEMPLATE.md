# Design Doc {NUMBER}: {TITLE}

## Status

> A Status may be Draft if we want to break discussion in few PRs to break down a longer process in few steps.
> At the end of the process each design has to be either Accepted or Declined.
> If a later design doc significantly changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked
> as superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

{Draft|Accepted|Declined|Superseded}

## Abstract

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the problem or feature.
> Keep it short. Max 200 words.

## Context

> This section contains all the context one needs to understand the current state,
> and why there is a problem. It should be as succinct as possible and introduce
> the high level idea behind the solution.

## Proposal

> This section records the decision that was made and how it should work.
> It is best to record as much info as possible from the discussion that happened.
> This aids in not having to go back to the Pull Request and comments to get the needed information.
> You can include diagrams.
>
> - What new data structures are needed, what data structures will be changed?
> - What are the efficiency considerations (time/space)?
> - What are the expected access patterns (load/throughput)?
> - Are there any privacy considerations?
> - If the change is large, how will the changes be broken up for ease of review?

### User requirements

> Specify expected user behavior

### Outcomes

> Here are some common questions that get answered as part of the detailed design:
>
> - What are the expected outcomes?
> - What systems will be affected?
> - Are there any observability needs?
> - Are there any security considerations (social, systematic, engineering, ...)?
> - Are any of these changes in conflict with the existing solution?
> - Does this proposal require coordination with other teams?

## Alternative Approaches

> This section contains information around alternative options that are considered
> before making a decision. It should contain a explanation on why the alternative
> approach(es) were not chosen.

## Consequences

> This section describes the consequences, after applying the decision. All
> consequences should be summarized here, not just the "positive" ones.

### Positive

### Negative

### Neutral

### Backwards Compatibility

> All design docs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The doc must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. Submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Further Discussions

> This section should contain potential followups or issues to be solved in future iterations (usually referencing comments from a pull-request discussion).

## Comments

> Optional. Provide additional important comments.
> If the proposal is rejected, document why it was rejected.

## References

> Are there any relevant PR comments, issues that led up to this, or articles
> referenced for why we made the given design choice? If so link them here!
